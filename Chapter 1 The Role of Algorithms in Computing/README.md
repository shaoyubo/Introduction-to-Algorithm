# Chapter 1. The Role of Algorithms in Computing

## 1.1 Algorithms

**Sorting Problem**

- Input: A sequence of n numbers a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ... , a<sub>n</sub>.

- Ouput: A permutation (reordering) b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, ... , b<sub>n</sub> of the input sequence such that 
b<sub>1</sub> &le; b<sub>2</sub> &le; ... &le; b<sub>n</sub>.

**What kinds of problems are solved in algorithms?**

- The Human Genome Project (DNA).

- Access and retrieve large amounts of information.

- Public-key cryptography and digital signatures.

- Allocate scarce resources for manufacturing and other commercial enterprises.

**Data Structure**

- A data structure is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.

## 1.2 Algorithms as a technology

**Efficiency**

- Different algorithms devised to solve the same problem often differ dramatically in their efficiency. These differences can be much more significant than differences due to hardware and software.

**Algorithms and other technologies**

- Total system performance depends on choosing efficient algorithms as much as choosing fast hardware.

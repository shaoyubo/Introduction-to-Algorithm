# Chapter 1. The Role of Algorithms in Computing

## 1.1 Algorithms

**Sorting Problem**

- Input: A sequence of n numbers a<sub>1</sub>, a<sub>2</sub>, ... , a<sub>n</sub>

- Ouput: A permutation (reordering) b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, ... , b<sub>n</sub> of the input sequence such that 
b<sub>1</sub> <= b<sub>2</sub> <= ... <= b<sub>n</sub>

**Data Structure**
A data structure is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.

## 1.2 Algorithms as a technology
**Efficiency**
Different algorithms devised to solve the same problem often differ dramatically in their efficiency. These differences can be much more significant than differences due to hardware and software.

# Chapter 7. Quicksort

The quicksort algorithm has a worst-case running time of &Theta(n<sup>2</sup>) on an input array of n numbers. Despite this slow worst-case running time, quicksort is often the best practical choice for sorting because it is remarkably efficient on the average: its expected running time is &Theta;(nlg n), and the constant factors hidden in the &Theta;(nlg n) notation are quite small.
